Hi, my name is Ismail and I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science at NYU. 
I wasn't always a programmer though. I started off pursuing a Mechanical Engineering 
degree at Juniata College. I was in a 3-2 engineering program where I spend three 
years at a liberal arts college, followed by two years at a school that offers 
engineering. After my three years stint at Juniata, I graduated with a degree in 
enginering physics and transfered to Columbia where I spent the final two years pursuing 
a Mechanical Engineering degree. 

Throughout this time, I found myself focusing on the programming side of things when it 
came to projects. I finally decided to jump in head first by cramming a computer science 
minor in my last year of Columbia. As a result, I applied to a Master's program in 
Computer Science at NYU in order to further my studies. During the summer prior to beginning my 
Master's studies, I began a startup with two other friends where we developed an iOS app that 
allowed users to spread images in the same way a virus spreads. The app never launched but 
I learned a lot of "what not to do" during this summer. 

I was so intrigued by iOS app development that I deferred my Master's degree and 
decided to apply to the Flatiron School in New York to continue learning about how to 
make iOS apps. After the program, I continued my studies at NYU and began freelancing iOS apps 
as well as working on my own projects that you can see in the "Projects" section.  

My current hobbies include iOS app development, machine learning, learning Haskell, horseback 
riding with my girlfriend, playing with my little 4 lb yorkie Buttons, and exploring New York
City.
