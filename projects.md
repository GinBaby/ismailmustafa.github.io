## Rubik's Hacks - October 2015
I built <a href="http://devpost.com/software/ru6-x-h-x">Rubik's Hacks</a> along with
<a href="https://github.com/jayrav13">Jay Ravaliya</a>. Rubik's Hacks is an iOS app that can
solve a Rubik's cube. I built te brute force solver using Haskell and jay tackled the image
recognition side of things using swift. The end result was an iOS app that could use image
recognition to analyze a cube through pictures, and a haskell API that could receive this
information and return a solution on how to solve the cube. Technologies used include the
Haskell web framework "Scotty", and iOS.

## MyoDrums - July 2015
I built <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/myodrums">MyoDrums</a> (*Winner of the Best Myoband Hack*)

<a href="https://github.com/bmax">Brandon Max</a>. MyoDrums is a virtual drumset
created using a MyoBand as the right drumstick and an iPhone as the left drumstick.
Linking the movements with sounds over websockets, we could effectively drum with
anyone around the world at the same time. Technologies used include Rails, websockets,
iOS, a MyoBand, and iOS's coremotion API. You can watch highlights from the event below:

## Mews - Fall 2014

read anymore news that could potentially sadden you. Technologies in this project include
Flask, SentiWordNet, and the "USA Today" API.
